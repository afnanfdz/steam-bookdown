Thank you Yihui Xie for this great resource. About the book This book draws from a single dataset on Steam games on December 15, that details various information on the 1999 most popular Steam games (by concurrent players that date). Take a look: Why December 15th? Thats the date I pulled my dataset from for two projects for two seperate courses that semester. It was also a particularly interesting time for Steam, since December is likely a livelier time for video games, and Halo Infinite, which was highly anticipated, came out around this time. Furthermore, while the code I used for generating the data is fully automated and reusable (meaning I could easily get a dataset for whenever today is when you read this), it does take a long time to run, and, since Ive already done work on this dataset before, I can refer to my finished projects to make sure things are consistent (this book is essentially a rewrite, but a lot tidier, better-explained and everythings in one place). Why 1999 games only? If youre asking why Im 1 less than 2000 off-by-one error. If youre asking why not more, its because past 2000, the games in that category are almost completely unplayed, barely-sold, and such. The game graveyard, or the underside of the iceberg, if you will. These are games that never emerged for one reason or another, and therefore I dont count them in my dataset because I would like to mostly interact with games that are played and are relatively known to the space. Where did the data come from? TODO Acknowledgements This book is a remaster of final projects from two statistics courses: STAT 207 (Data Science Exploration), on the Data Science pipeline through Python using pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib and seaborn. Taught by Dr Victoria Ellison. STAT 385 (Statistics Programming Methods), on applying our lessons on data wrangling and plotting using tidyverse libraries in R, to develop a single Shiny application. Taught by Dr David Dalpiaz. My thanks go to both of these instructors for getting me inspired to do data science! Furthermore, Daves use of bookdown for his course websites and textbooks have motivated me further to practice writing my own things in said library, such as this book!
